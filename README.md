# Project Title: From Pixels to Peaks: AI-Driven DEM Inpainting for Glacier Mass Determination

This project is part of my master thesis and aims to use Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) to inpaint missing parts in Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The ultimate goal is to generate a plausible representation of subglacial topography, which can then be used to estimate the mass of the glaciers.

This Work adapted and extended the findings of: 

"Void Filling of Digital Elevation Model with Deep Generative Models", Gavriil et al. (2019) 

And

"Generative Image Inpainting With Contextual Attention", Yu et al. (2018)
